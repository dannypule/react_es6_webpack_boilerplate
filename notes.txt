Another way to serve the contents of the directory through a server, such as serve (npm i serve -g). In this case, execute 'serve' at the output directory and head to localhost:3000 at your browser. You can configure the port through the --port parameter.

netstat -na | grep 3000 // shows you the status of port 3000 if it's in use
