A boilerplate for React ES6 Webpack and Babel. Early version and is being improved upon.

## GETTING STARTED
1) Clone this repo and create a new directory called 'react-boilerplate' by running this code:
```
git clone https://github.com/dannypule/react-es6-webpack-babel-boilerplate.git react-boilerplate
```

2) cd into project directory:
```
cd react-boilerplate
```

3) Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

4) Run webpack-dev-sever:
```
npm start
```

5) Open in browser:

Launch your browser and go to localhost:1983


6) Modify and enjoy.

When you make a change to your code, the browser will update to show your changes. Hot Module Replacement is in use so in most cases the brower will not need to be reloaded and your new code will show up instantly while maintaining your application's state.

### More improvements coming soon!
